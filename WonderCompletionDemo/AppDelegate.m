 \section intro_sec Introduction
 
 This application simulates a completion of personal wonders.
 
 
 The program has the following main tasks
 \li Create list items
 \li Change values on them
 \li Order or delete them as you prefer
 \li Simulate synchronization with a backend to update the work complete
 \li Completed items are signaled (audio and checkmark)
 
 \subsection

 \subsection localization
 Once stable use in the console
 <pre>
 genstrings ./Classes/\*.m
 </pre>
 to generate Localizable.strings, make sure that while importing into xcode to transform to UTF-16, open info, make file localizable, add languages by adding 2letter codes (de,it,fr,es,pt etc.)
 
 \section Tips_sec Tips and Tricks for debugging
 
 \subsection browsedb_sec Browsing database content
 to open the database for browsing you should download base.app . you can then browse the database by using the path you copy from the log i.e.:
 
 <pre>
 #just an example, the path is written in the console
 cd "/Users/juergen/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/01FBD44C-BD16-478B-8CD1-85CBDC256764/Documents"
 ls -l *sqlite
 open -a Base *sqlite
 </pre>
 
 \subsection Browsedata_sec Browsing data of users documents
 to browse the files downloaded in the finder (as you usually will not see the Library):
 <tt>open -a finder "/Users/juergen/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/01FBD44C-BD16-478B-8CD1-85CBDC256764/Documents"</tt>
 
 \section Libraries
 
 \subsection MKNetworkKit
 MKNetworkKit is used for download and upload of data, images. It's used also to test the Reachability of the network while the syncronization process is taking place.
 
 
 \subsection ELCImagePicker ELCImagePickerController
 ELCImagePicker is used to load the photo and video library to select some photos or videos before the upload process to the server.
